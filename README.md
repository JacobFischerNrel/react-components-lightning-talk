# React Components Lightning Talk

This is a simple Next.js app that demonstrates the different ways to create
components within React, and compares and contrasts the benefits of each, with
an emphasis on the newer Server Components architecture.

## Requirements

Just [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). Really.

I'd usually recommend `nvm` (Node Version Manager) to help you install
node versions. Specifically `v20.16.0` was used for this project.

After you have node ready just do:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then go to `http://localhost:3000`.

Yeah, no docker. I was lazy, and wanted to keep it simple, seriously.
